    "summary": "This case involves an appeal against a ruling of the Lagos High Court which made absolute a garnishee order against Access Bank PLC. The respondents had obtained a garnishee order nisi requiring the bank to show cause why the order should not be made absolute regarding funds held in accounts of judgment debtors. The bank filed an affidavit claiming the judgment debtors had no active accounts, stating their accounts had been closed since 2009. However, the bank's evidence was found to be contradictory and evasive, presenting statements for different account numbers than those specified in the order nisi, and failing to provide comprehensive account histories. The High Court made the garnishee order absolute, leading to this appeal. The Court of Appeal upheld the lower court's decision, finding that the bank failed to properly discharge its duty to show cause by not making full and frank disclosures about the relevant accounts.",
    "outcome": "The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal and affirmed the lower court's garnishee order absolute against Access Bank PLC. The court found that the appellant bank failed in its duty to show cause why the garnishee order nisi should not have been made absolute.",
    "ratios": [
        "A garnishee bank has obligation to carry out the orders of the court and must supply the details of the accounts listed and nothing else.",
        "The onus placed on a garnishee would only be discharged where it successfully establishes that the account referred to in the decree nisi does not exist in its system or if it exists, it is heavily in debt and not in credit, or that the number stated on the order nisi had since changed to another version.",
        "Parties confronting the courts with facts must do so with certainty and some good measure of exactness. Parties must not expect the courts to embark on titration process to filter the facts.",
        "A party who has been given the opportunity to make his case but fails to do so cannot come under the guise of fair hearing"
