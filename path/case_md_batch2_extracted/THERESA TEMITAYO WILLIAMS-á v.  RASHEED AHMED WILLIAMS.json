    "summary": "This case concerns a custody dispute over Kafilat Abimbola Williams, the only daughter among three children of divorced parents. While the father had custody of the two sons who were studying in England, the mother had been caring for the daughter since their separation in 1975. The trial court granted custody of the daughter to the mother, but the Court of Appeal reversed this decision. The Supreme Court ultimately ordered joint custody, with the mother retaining care and control while the father would be responsible for education expenses. The court emphasized that the paramount consideration in custody matters is the welfare of the child, rather than the rights or preferences of either parent.",
    "outcome": "The Supreme Court allowed the appeal and ordered joint custody of Kafilat Abimbola Williams, with the mother exercising care and control while the father takes charge of the child's education and related expenses.",
    "ratios": [
        "The welfare of the child is the first and paramount consideration in custody matters, not the claims of either parent",
        "The custody order is not a penal order on either parent but imposes a responsibility not to be lightly taken",
        "For a child of tender years, education outside the proper environment (country of origin) is bound to give a distorted view of life and cannot be in the best interest of the child",
        "An order for joint custody is appropriate where both parents are qualified and likely to cooperate in the child's interest"

Every Court has a duty to do its best to arrive at a proper and just decision. And if an appellate court is satisfied that the decision of the court below is improper, unjust or wrong then the decision must be set aside.'"
