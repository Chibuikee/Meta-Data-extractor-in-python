    "summary": "The case concerns an appeal arising from the National and State Houses of Assembly Election Tribunal. The 2nd appellant was a candidate of the 1st appellant (APC) for the Calabar/Odukpani Federal House Constituency, Cross River State. The 1st appellant sought to be joined as a party to an election petition and requested leave to file a cross-petition. The Tribunal dismissed their application, finding it was filed well outside the statutory 21-day period for election petitions (filed 105 days after election results were announced). The appellants appealed this dismissal. The Court of Appeal upheld the Tribunal's decision, emphasizing that election matters are sui generis and must strictly comply with statutory time limits. The court found that the attempt to join the proceedings and file a cross-petition long after the 21-day statutory period was impermissible.",
    "outcome": "The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal and affirmed the ruling of the National and State Houses of Assembly Election Petition Tribunal which had refused the appellants' application for joinder and leave to file a cross-petition.",
    "ratios": [
        "A final decision is one that leaves nothing to be judicially determined or ascertained thereafter, in order to render it effective and capable of execution, and is absolute, complete, and certain.",
        "Election matters are sui generis and are governed by definite provisions of the law which must be strictly applied.",
        "An election petition shall be filed within twenty-one days after the date of the declaration of results of the election, where 'after' means the next day.",
        "A person does not become a necessary party merely because he has an interest in the correct solution of some questions involved and is afraid that the existing party may not advance same adequately."
