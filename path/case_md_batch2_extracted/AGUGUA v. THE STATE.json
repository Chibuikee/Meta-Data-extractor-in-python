    "summary": "The appellant and one Aliyu Danjuma were charged with conspiracy to commit armed robbery and armed robbery contrary to Sections 5(b) and 1(2)(a) of the Robbery and Firearms Act. On December 9, 2007, the appellant and accomplices entered a house at Sabon-Birnin Road, Sokoto, armed with guns. They demanded money and collected mobile phones from the occupants. During their escape, one of their motorcycles failed to start, leading to their eventual arrest. The appellant made a confessional statement (Exhibit F1) which was admitted after a trial-within-trial. The trial court convicted the appellant for conspiracy and a lesser offense of attempted robbery instead of armed robbery, sentencing him to life imprisonment. The Court of Appeal affirmed this decision, leading to the appeal to the Supreme Court, which ultimately dismissed the appeal and upheld the lower courts' decisions.",
    "outcome": "The Supreme Court dismissed the appeal and affirmed the conviction and sentence of life imprisonment for conspiracy and attempted robbery as determined by the lower courts.",
    "ratios": [
        "A confession is admissible and should be admitted, once it is found to be direct and positive and it relates to the acts, knowledge or intention of the maker, stating or suggesting the inference that he committed the crime charged.",
        "A confessional statement does not become inadmissible merely because it was subsequently retracted by the maker.",
        "An accused person can be convicted on his confessional statement alone where the confession is consistent with other ascertained facts which have been proved.",
        "There is no law insisting that the prosecution must always tender weapon or gun used in a robbery in order to establish its case. It largely depends on the facts and circumstances of each given case.",
        "A freely made confession, whether judicial or extra judicial, so long as it is found to be direct positive and proper proved, is sufficient proof of guilt and conviction could be rightly based entirely on such statement."
