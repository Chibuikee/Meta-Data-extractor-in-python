    "summary": "The case involved a British passenger who suffered injuries on the steamship Majestic due to a negligently secured porthole glass. The injury occurred during a voyage from New York to Southampton, with the contract made in Detroit. The key legal issues centered on whether English or American law governed the contract, and whether certain contractual conditions exempted the defendants from liability. While negligence was established and damages provisionally assessed at Â£1,073.10s, the court ultimately ruled for the defendants because the plaintiff failed to comply with a contractual condition requiring notice of claim within three days of landing.",
    "outcome": "Judgment for the defendants due to the plaintiff's failure to comply with the notice requirement in the contract's ninth condition.",

            "context": "It was laid down in In re Missouri Steamship Co. (1) that where a contract is made in one country to be performed wholly or partly in another country the Court will look at all the circumstances to ascertain by the law of which country the parties may be presumed to have intended the contract to be governed, and will enforce it accordingly unless it should contain stipulations contrary to morality or expressly forbidden by positive law. In that case the contract was made between an American citizen and a British company of shipowners for the carriage of cattle from Boston to England in a British ship, and it contained a stipulation that was valid according to English law but was void by the law of Massachusetts on the same grounds as those on which the condition under consideration in the present case is void according to the lex loci contractus."

Vaughan Williams and Kennedy L.JJ. used language which might be taken as indicating that they thought the condition should receive the wide interpretation contended for. But in that case the negligence was in the navigation of the vessel, and navigation is one of the matters specifically mentioned in the condition. The question, therefore, of the application of the rule of ejusdem generis did not arise."
