    "summary": "The case involved a dispute over ownership of land located at kilometer 15 along Badagry Expressway, Lagos. The appellants claimed ownership through traditional history tracing back to their ancestor Ado, while the respondents (Odan Parapo family) contested this claim. The appellants relied on both a previous judgment (LD/1213/76) and traditional history to prove their ownership. The trial court found in favor of the appellants, but the Court of Appeal reversed this decision, holding that the previous judgment was statute-barred and that the appellants failed to prove their traditional history. On further appeal, the Supreme Court held that while the previous judgment could be relied upon as evidence of ownership (though not for enforcement after 12 years), the appellants had also satisfactorily proved their traditional history.",
    "outcome": "The Supreme Court allowed the appeal, set aside the Court of Appeal's judgment, and restored the trial court's judgment in favor of the appellants. The respondents were ordered to pay costs of N50,000 to each set of appellants.",
    "ratios": [
        "A judgment of a Court subsists in perpetuity, notwithstanding any error in law or facts therein, until, and unless, it is set aside or vacated by a Court of competent jurisdiction.",
        "An action brought upon a judgment is an invocation of the coercive powers of the trial court to enforce the enforceable orders in the judgment. It is not the judgment that is statute-barred, but an action to enforce the reliefs granted in the judgment.",
        "Where there is a conflict of traditional history, the best way is to test the traditional history by reference to facts in recent years established by evidence and by seeing which of the two competing histories is more probable."
