    "summary": "The case involves a dispute between the appellant and first respondent, both members of APC from Kware/Wammako Federal Constituency, Sokoto. The appellant filed an Originating Summons seeking declaratory and injunctive reliefs, alleging that the first respondent made false declarations regarding certificate acquisition. The trial Court struck out the suit for non-disclosure of reasonable cause of action and abuse of court process. The appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal but failed to challenge the key rationes decidendi regarding the absence of reasonable cause of action and abuse of court process. The Court of Appeal upheld the trial Court's ruling, leading to this further appeal to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court found that the appellant failed to prove the criminal allegations beyond reasonable doubt and had not shown the perversity of the concurrent judgments of the lower courts.",
    "outcome": "Appeal dismissed with costs of N800,000 awarded against the appellant",
