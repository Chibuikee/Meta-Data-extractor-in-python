    ],
    "summary": "The case involves an appeal against the judgment of the Ogun State High Court where the appellant and three others were convicted for conspiracy to commit armed robbery and armed robbery. The alleged incident occurred on March 29, 2009, at Onibudo Phase II, where the accused persons were said to have robbed Cecilia Akinsanya of an Omatek Laptop, Ankara Fabrics, and N6,000. The prosecution's case relied on the victim's testimony (PW1) and confessional statements. The appellant made two statements: one denying involvement (Exhibit D) and another confessing to the crime (Exhibit L). The Court of Appeal found that the prosecution failed to properly establish the appellant's identity as one of the robbers, noting that the victim did not identify him during the incident, no identification parade was conducted, and there was insufficient corroboration of the retracted confession. The Court of Appeal consequently set aside the conviction and discharged the appellant.",
    "outcome": "The appeal was allowed. The Court of Appeal set aside the conviction and death sentence imposed by the High Court, and the appellant was acquitted and discharged.",
    "ratios": [
        "A confessional statement of an accused person is not binding on a co-accused, except the statement was adopted by the co-accused",
        "Where an accused person makes a confessional statement to the police as to his participation or culpability in the crime charged, he is not confessing for his co-accused",
        "For the prosecution to secure a conviction for armed robbery, they must prove beyond reasonable doubt that there was a robbery, that it was an armed robbery, and that the accused was one of those who took part in the robbery",
        "The fact that an accused person has retracted his confessional statement does not mean that the court cannot act on it to convict him, but the court should evaluate if there is some other evidence outside the confession to show that the confession is true"
