    "summary": "This case concerns land acquisition by the Western Nigerian government in 1958 of 5000 acres across Badagry, Ikeja, and Lagos colony. After Lagos State's creation in 1967, approximately 929.6 acres fell within its jurisdiction. In 1979, Lagos State sought the Land Tribunal's determination of compensation. The tribunal awarded N1,141,631.20 to 34 claimants in 1981. Due to non-payment, the Akingbaiye family and others filed an originating summons seeking payment and interest. The High Court ordered staggered payments but declined interest payment. The Court of Appeal affirmed this decision. On further appeal, the Supreme Court held that both the High Court and Court of Appeal lacked jurisdiction to hear the matter as the Land Tribunal had exclusive jurisdiction under the Public Lands Acquisition Act 1976. The Supreme Court declared both lower court decisions null and void, while affirming the original Land Tribunal judgment awarding compensation without interest.",
    "outcome": "The Supreme Court dismissed the appeal, declared the High Court and Court of Appeal decisions null and void, and affirmed the original Land Tribunal judgment awarding N1,141,631.20 compensation without interest.",

        "When a court conducts proceedings in which it has no jurisdiction over the cause of action, the judgment given at the end of proceedings has no legal consequence, it binds no one. It is void without effect, a nullity.",
        "The judgment of the Lagos State Lands Tribunal, as with all courts of competent jurisdiction takes effect immediately upon delivery and the tribunal has inherent jurisdiction to proceed to enforce such judgment forthwith.",
        "Filing a fresh action after judgment has been delivered to enforce the judgment and seek interest is unknown under any principle of law."

(as he then was) and also at the Court of Appeal that the Lands Tribunal made a mandatory order that the respondents should pay the judgment debt of N1,141,631.20 (one million one hundred and forty-one thousand, six hundred and thirty-one naira twenty kobo) without further delay amounted to suppression of facts which nullify the judgment of the High Court and Appeal Court. Reliance was placed on Vulcan Gases Ltd. v. G.F.I.G."
