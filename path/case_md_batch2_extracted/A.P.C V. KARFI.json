    "summary": "The case concerns an appeal against the Court of Appeal's decision which upheld a Federal High Court ruling ordering fresh primaries for the Kura/Garun Malam State House Constituency of Kano State. The primary election conducted by APC on December 2, 2014, was declared inconclusive due to over-voting (603 votes cast versus 595 accredited delegates). Despite this, APC forwarded the 3rd appellant's name to INEC as their candidate. The 1st respondent challenged this at the Federal High Court, which ordered fresh primaries. The Court of Appeal upheld this decision and further ordered the 3rd appellant to vacate his seat. The Supreme Court found that APC had no valid candidate in the election due to the inconclusive primary and the party's failure to conduct fresh primaries as ordered.",
    "outcome": "The Supreme Court dismissed the appeal and ordered the 3rd appellant to vacate his seat, directed INEC to withdraw his certificate of return and issue same to the runner-up in the general election, and ordered him to refund all salaries and allowances received within 90 days.",
    "ratios": [
        "An inconclusive primary election cannot produce a candidate for a general election",
        "Where a political party fails to comply with the mandatory provisions of the Electoral Act on nomination of candidates before the general election, the court will intervene and declare such purported nomination invalid",
        "The courts will not allow a political party to act arbitrarily or as it likes. Political parties must obey their own constitution",
        "Any proven case of over-voting in an election should render such an election void",
        "A candidate not validly nominated as required by law cannot be said to have qualified to be placed on the ballot in an election"

Omugadu (2013) 18 NWLR (Pt. 1385) 79, a case which was relied upon by the court below that an inconclusive primary election cannot produce a candidate. In fact, this court emphatically held at page 126, paragraphs C - D that '... I wish to add that there can be no nomination of a candidate and acquisition of vested interest in an inconclusive party primary election.'"
