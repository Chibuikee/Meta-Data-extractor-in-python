    "summary": "The case involved a tank steamer Edward Dawson, owned by Lennard's Carrying Company, which was chartered to transport benzine. Due to defective boilers, the ship encountered problems off the Dutch coast, leading to groundings and ultimately a fire that destroyed the cargo. The Asiatic Petroleum Company (cargo owners) sued for damages. The key issue was whether the shipping company could be protected under Section 502 of the Merchant Shipping Act, which limits owner liability for fire damage if it occurs without their 'actual fault or privity'. The court established that Mr. Lennard, as the directing mind of the company, had knowledge of the ship's unseaworthy condition, and his fault was attributable to the company itself.",
    "outcome": "The appeal was dismissed with costs, holding the appellant company liable as the unseaworthiness existed with their actual fault or privity through Mr. Lennard, who represented the directing mind and will of the corporation.",
    "ratios": [
        "A corporation's active and directing will must be sought in the person who is the directing mind and will of the corporation, the very ego and centre of the personality of the corporation",
        "The fault must not only be the fault of a servant to exonerate the owner, but must also be one which is not the fault of the owner or to which the owner is privy",
        "When invoking section 502 to excuse oneself from the normal consequences of respondeat superior, the burden lies upon the party claiming the exemption"
