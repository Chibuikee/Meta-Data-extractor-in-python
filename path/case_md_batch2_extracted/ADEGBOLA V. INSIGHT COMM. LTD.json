    "summary": "The case involved a professional model (Adegbola) who entered into a one-year contract with Insight Communications for a Starcomms TV commercial. The contract was to run from May 2005 to May 2006. After the contract expired, Starcomms continued to use the advertisement materials without renegotiating with the model. This unauthorized use led to the termination of another contract the model had with DDB Lagos Ltd worth ₦5,000,000. The main issues were whether Insight Communications acted as Starcomms' agent, and whether Starcomms had unlimited rights to use the advertising materials after the contract period. The trial court dismissed the appellant's claims, but the Court of Appeal found that Starcomms had breached the appellant's rights by using the materials without consent after the contract period, and that Insight Communications was not Starcomms' agent despite claiming to act on their behalf.",
    "outcome": "The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal and awarded the appellant ₦5,000,000 in special damages against Starcomms (2nd respondent) for wrongful breach of his right to further use of the advertisement materials. The court also awarded ₦100,000 as costs against Starcomms.",

        "A contract in law is a legally binding agreement between two or more persons (natural and/or corporate) by which rights are acquired by one party in return for acts of consideration or forbearances, on the part of the others",
        "Agency relationship arises from the consent, express or implied, between two parties for one to act for and on behalf of the other in regard of third parties",
        "A party cannot alone appoint itself an agent of another in its dealing or relationship with third parties without the requisite consent or authority of the party for whom or on whose behalf the action is said to have been done",
        "Where there was no existing valid and enforceable contract which binds the parties thereto, there cannot possibly be a maintainable allegation of breach of any terms and conditions that can sustain a claim for damages for breach of contract"
