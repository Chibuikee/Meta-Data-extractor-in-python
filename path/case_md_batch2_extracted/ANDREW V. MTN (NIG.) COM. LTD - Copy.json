    "summary": "The case involves a dispute between a subscriber and MTN Nigeria over the disclosure of information to aid police investigation. The appellant was a former MTN subscriber whose old line was allegedly being used by an impersonator to defraud friends and family. The appellant reported the matter to the police, who requested information from MTN to identify the person using the line. MTN's failure to provide this information led to the legal action. The trial court granted declaratory orders compelling MTN to release the information but denied the appellant's claim for general damages, stating that the appellant failed to prove entitlement to such damages. On appeal, the Court of Appeal found that general damages need not be specifically proved and awarded N5 million in general damages to the appellant.",
    "outcome": "The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal, set aside the trial court's denial of general damages, and awarded N5,000,000 in general damages to the appellant, plus N100,000 in costs.",
    "ratios": [
        "General damages need not be specifically pleaded, not to talk of proof. It arises from the inference of law and need not be proved by evidence. It suffices if it is generally averred.",
        "The award of general damages is presumed by law to be the direct and probable consequence or result of the act complained of.",
        "General damages as claimed by the appellant for the loss and injury she incurred by the respondent not releasing the information required to enable the police investigate his complaint through his letter of request, exhibit 4, are claims made at large, it is quantified according to the opinion of the reasonable person."

The manner therefore in which general damages is quantified, is by relying on what would be the opinion and judgment of a reasonable man.'"
