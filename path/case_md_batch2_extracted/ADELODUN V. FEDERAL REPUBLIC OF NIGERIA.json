    "summary": "This appeal challenges the judgment of M. AbdulGafar J in case No. KWS/40C/2012, where the appellant was convicted of conspiracy to obtain money under false pretense, obtaining money under false pretense, and conspiracy to forge a document. The case involved the fraudulent transfer of N59,006,250 from the University of Ilorin's account to Bamestic Multi-ventures through forged documents. The appellant, along with co-conspirators, used a falsified letter (Exhibit 11) to deceive UBA Plc into transferring the funds. The appellant opened a bank account under false pretenses and withdrew the funds within days. The trial court found the appellant guilty based on evidence showing conspiracy and fraudulent intent. The appellant challenged the conviction on grounds including improper admission of evidence and material contradictions, but the Court of Appeal dismissed all grounds and upheld the conviction.",
    "outcome": "The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal and affirmed the trial court's conviction of the appellant for conspiracy to obtain money by false pretense, obtaining money by false pretense, and conspiracy to forge documents. The sentences imposed and order for compensation were also upheld.",
    "ratios": [
        "Where a document was shown to be used as an intermediate step in the scheme of fraud in which an accused person was involved, then if it was shown that such document was false and was presented or uttered by an accused person in order to gain advantage, an irresistible inference exists that either the accused forged the document with his own hand or procured someone to commit the forgery",
        "The act of a co-conspirator done in furtherance of a criminal scheme is the act of the other co-conspirators",
        "A charge of conspiracy is proved by either leading direct evidence in proof of the common design or it can be proved by inference derived from the commission of the substantive offence",
        "Only material contradictions and not just minor discrepancies could tilt the scale of conviction"

The State (supra), to the effect that the act of a co-conspirator done in furtherance of a criminal scheme is the act of the other co-conspirators, in other words, it having been established that 1st accused person conspired with the appellant to forge, and did forge exhibit 11, the simple deduction is that appellant is similarly taken as having forged the said document."
