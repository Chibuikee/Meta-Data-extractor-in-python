    "summary": "The case involves a foreign national charged with conspiracy and illegal dealing in petroleum products without proper authorization. The appellant was charged for dealing in 1,733.087 metric tons of petroleum products without lawful authority and storing 1,500 metric tons of automated Gas Oil and 3,0135 metric tons of Low Pour Fuel Oil in the vessel MT Anuket Emerald. The appellant challenged the Federal High Court's jurisdiction and the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission's (EFCC) authority to prosecute without the Attorney General's prior consent. The key issues centered around whether the Attorney General's consent was required to prosecute a foreigner, the court's jurisdiction over offenses in Nigeria's territorial waters, and the extent of Nigerian courts' jurisdiction over offenses committed outside Nigeria. The Court of Appeal affirmed the lower court's ruling, holding that the EFCC had constitutional authority to prosecute under Section 174 of the 1999 Constitution without requiring the Attorney General's prior consent.",
    "outcome": "The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal and affirmed the ruling of the Federal High Court, finding that the EFCC had proper authority to prosecute and the lower court had jurisdiction.",
    "ratios": [
        "The EFCC shares prosecutorial power as 'any other authority' with the Attorney-General of the Federation under Section 174 of the 1999 Constitution",
        "Section 174 of the 1999 Constitution overrides Section 3(1) and (a) of the Territorial Waters Act",
        "The EFCC does not require the consent or fiat or certificate of the Attorney-General of the Federation to institute charges related to economic and financial crimes as defined in Section 46 of the EFCC Act"
