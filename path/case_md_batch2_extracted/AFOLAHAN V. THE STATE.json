    "summary": "The appellant was charged with conspiracy and armed robbery at the High Court of Osun State. The prosecution alleged that on December 21, 1999, the appellant and others robbed Alhaja Sariyu at gunpoint, stealing N140,000 and bank documents. The appellant claimed he was merely a commercial motorcyclist who had transported someone to the scene. He was convicted and sentenced to death by the trial court, which was affirmed by the Court of Appeal. The Supreme Court found that the prosecution failed to prove the case beyond reasonable doubt, noting problems with the appellant's confession (Exhibit Q) and lack of corroborating evidence. The court also noted that a key suspect identified as having a gun was released without explanation. The Supreme Court allowed the appeal, setting aside the lower courts' decisions and acquitting the appellant.",
    "outcome": "The Supreme Court allowed the appeal, set aside the judgments of both lower courts, and discharged and acquitted the appellant of the charges of conspiracy to commit armed robbery and armed robbery.",
    "ratios": [
        "When a statement (like Exhibit Q) is excluded from evidence, as it should be, and there is insufficient evidence left on record which could have sustained the verdict of guilt returned by the trial court, the inevitable conclusion is that the guilt of the appellant was not established.",
        "Where there are doubts as to the guilt of an accused person, such doubts must be resolved in favor of the accused.",
        "Where prosecution's evidence is found to be contradictory on a material issue, the court should give the benefit of that doubt to an accused person that stems from the non-credibility of such evidence and discharge and acquit him."
